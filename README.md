# Brain_Tumour_Detection

Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks

Project Overview
This project aims to automate the early detection of brain tumors from MRI scans using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Early detection can help doctors diagnose tumors faster and more accurately, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Features
Classifies MRI brain scans into tumor and no tumor categories.
Utilizes a CNN architecture for feature extraction and accurate prediction.
Provides visualization of predictions and model performance metrics.
Can be further expanded for real-time diagnostic applications.

Results
High accuracy in classifying MRI images as tumor or no tumor.

Confusion matrix and performance metrics available in the notebook.

Future Improvements
Implement data augmentation to improve model robustness.

Deploy as a web application or API for real-time tumor detection.

Experiment with pretrained CNN architectures (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet) for higher accuracy.
